    Search String      : Bug#36663782
    Change Reason      : The system is validating all the accounts against the product account restriction, irrespective of the account type (Accounts or GL Accounts). 
                         Due to the high number of GL accounts, which is causing slowness in getting results.
                         Fix Description:Pay, Receive and Charge account related LOV's have been modified to consider the product restrictions for Nostro Accounts only for Customer Accounts.
